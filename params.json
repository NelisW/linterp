{"body":"### What is linterp?\r\nThis is a C++ header-only library for N-dimensional linear interpolation on a rectangular grid, similar to Matlab's [interpn](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interpn.html) command. Arbitrary dimensions are supported, but must be specified as a template parameter at compile time. Two linear interpolation algorithms can be used:\r\n* Multilinear: Interpolate using the N-dimensional hypercube containing the point. The interpolation step is O(2^N), but more accurate.\r\n* Simplicial: Interpolate using the N-dimensional simplex containing the point. The interpolation step is O(N log N), so this algorithm becomes much faster in higher dimensions, at the cost of decreased accuracy.\r\nRequires the [boost.multi_array](www.boost.org/libs/multi_array) library.\r\n\r\nFor a description of the two interpolation algorithms, see:\r\n* Weiser & Zarantonello (1988), \"A Note on Piecewise Linear and Multilinear Table Interpolation in Many Dimensions\", _Mathematics of Computation_ 50 (181), p. 189-196\r\n* Davies (1996), \"Multidimensional Triangulation and Interpolation for Reinforcement Learning\", _Proceedings of Neural Information Processing Systems 1996_\r\n\r\n### Python interface\r\nA Python interface is provided, using Andreas Kl√∂ckner's [pyublas] (http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyublas) library.\r\n\r\n### Matlab interface\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```","tagline":"N-dimensional linear interpolation on a rectangular grid in C++","note":"Don't delete this file!
